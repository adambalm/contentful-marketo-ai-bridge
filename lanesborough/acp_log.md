**Decision:** Day 4 Implementation Plan - Create backend/schemas/ directory with Pydantic models (ArticleIn and ActivationPayload), implement /activate POST endpoint, create services structure with mock Contentful/Marketo/OpenAI integrations, and establish project configuration files.
**GA Contribution:** Provided comprehensive architectural plan with specific file structures, validation requirements, and API endpoint design.
**IA Contribution:** Validated plan against technical constraints, confirmed mock service approach for MVP demonstration, and executed implementation with proper error handling.

**Decision:** Provider-Agnostic AI Service Implementation - Replace mock OpenAI service with real provider pattern supporting both OpenAI API and future local models via environment-based selection, enabling cost-effective testing and fine-tuning narrative.
**GA Contribution:** Specified abstract provider architecture with OpenAIProvider for real API integration and LocalModelProvider stub, plus environment configuration strategy.
**IA Contribution:** Validated existing codebase state, implemented complete provider pattern with error handling, real OpenAI integration for summary/keyword generation, and updated all configuration files.

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-04 17:15:00 UTC
**Decision:** Comprehensive Testing Strategy for AI Service - Implement unit testing discipline with pytest-mock for external dependency isolation, Pydantic schema validation via AIEnrichmentPayload model, and expanded coverage including provider selection, API mocking, error handling, and edge cases.
**GA Contribution:** Defined testing principles with external dependency mocking, specified core test requirements for provider selection and response parsing, and mandated Pydantic schema validation over dictionary assertions.
**IA Contribution:** Enhanced coverage with error handling tests, created AIEnrichmentPayload schema for type safety, implemented comprehensive test suite with 15+ test cases covering all providers and validation scenarios, and updated ai_service.py to return Pydantic models.

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-04 18:30:00 UTC
**Decision:** Automated Quality Gates via Pre-commit Hooks - Implement pre-commit framework with ruff, black, and pytest hooks to ensure automated code quality enforcement and prevent technical debt through Git commit blocking.
**GA Contribution:** Proposed industry-standard pre-commit framework with declarative configuration, specified core checks (ruff, black, pytest), and mandated automated blocking of commits with failures.
**IA Contribution:** Enhanced configuration with proper repository structure, virtual environment handling for pytest hook, PYTHONPATH setup, added pre-commit dependency, created comprehensive README documentation with development workflow, and validated functionality with test commits.

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-05 02:30:00 UTC
**Decision:** Comprehensive Frontend Implementation & Async Architecture - Create complete Contentful App with React sidebar interface, migrate all Pydantic schemas to V2, implement HubSpot integration as Marketo alternative, and establish async httpx architecture following FastAPI best practices.
**GA Contribution:** Identified critical gaps between MVP roadmap and reality - missing Contentful App frontend, proposed HubSpot as more accessible alternative to Marketo sandbox delays, specified need for async architecture consistency.
**IA Contribution:** Implemented complete React Contentful App with activation UI, error handling, and configuration screen; migrated all Pydantic V1 to V2 syntax; created async HubSpot service with httpx; built marketing platform factory with AsyncMarketingAdapter for sync/async compatibility; updated .env configuration for multiple providers; expanded test coverage to 23 tests; resolved directory naming mismatch by renaming to match remote repository.
