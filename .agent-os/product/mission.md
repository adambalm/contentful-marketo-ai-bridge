# AI Content Activation Engine

## Mission

Transform marketing operations through AI-powered content governance that creates auditable, repeatable workflows bridging Contentful CMS with marketing automation platforms.

## Core Value Proposition

Reduce content activation lifecycle from hours/days to seconds through automated enrichment, validation, and syndication while maintaining enterprise-grade auditability.

## Problem Solved

**The Marketing Activation Bottleneck:** Marketing teams face 2-3 day content-to-campaign cycles due to manual tagging, validation, and syndication processes. Industry statistics show 35% missing meta descriptions, 26% missing alt text, and 60-70% unused content due to poor metadata.
