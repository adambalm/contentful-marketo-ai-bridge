# Vision Model Integration Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for automated alt text generation to address accessibility compliance gaps in the AI Content Activation Engine.

> Created: 2025-09-06
> Version: 1.0.0
> Status: Implemented
> Reference: @.agent-os/product/mission.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Automated Alt Text Generation**: Generate descriptive alt text for images using vision AI models
- **Provider-Agnostic Architecture**: Support both OpenAI gpt-4o (production) and Qwen 2.5VL 7b (local development)
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Generate alt text that considers the surrounding content context
- **Integration with Content Flow**: Seamlessly integrate with existing content activation pipeline

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds for single image processing
- **Accuracy**: >90% semantic accuracy in generated alt text
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation to manual workflow
- **Cost Optimization**: Local model fallback to minimize API costs during development

### Quality Requirements
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for image descriptions
- **Brand Consistency**: Alt text should align with Contentful brand voice guidelines
- **Content Relevance**: Generated text must be contextually appropriate for marketing content

## Approach

### Architecture Pattern
```python
# Vision provider interface
class VisionProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_alt_text(self, image_url: str, context: str) -> str:
        pass

# Factory pattern for provider selection
class VisionServiceFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_service() -> VisionProvider:
        provider = os.getenv("AI_PROVIDER", "openai").lower()
        if provider == "local":
            return QwenVisionProvider()
        return OpenAIVisionProvider()
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Provider Interface**: Abstract base class defining vision capabilities
2. **OpenAI Implementation**: gpt-4o vision API integration for production
3. **Local Model Implementation**: Qwen 2.5VL 7b for development and cost control
4. **Context Processing**: Extract relevant context from article content for better alt text
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to manual alt text entry if vision processing fails

### Integration Points
- **Content Validation**: Integrate with existing Pydantic ArticleIn schema validation
- **AI Service Factory**: Extend existing AI service pattern to include vision capabilities
- **ActivationLog**: Record vision processing results for audit and improvement
- **Brand Voice Analysis**: Apply brand voice scoring to generated alt text

## External Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: gpt-4o vision model for production alt text generation
- **API Key Management**: Secure credential handling for OpenAI API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect OpenAI API rate limits and quota management

### Development Dependencies
- **Local Model Infrastructure**: Qwen 2.5VL 7b model setup and inference
- **Model Storage**: Local model weights and configuration management
- **GPU Resources**: Optional GPU acceleration for local model inference

### Integration Dependencies
- **Image URL Access**: Ability to access images from Contentful CDN
- **Content Context**: Access to article title, body, and campaign tags for context
- **Validation Pipeline**: Integration with existing content validation workflow
