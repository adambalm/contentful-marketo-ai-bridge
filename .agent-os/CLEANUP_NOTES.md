# Cleanup Notes for Final Extraction

## Current State
- Agent OS was added mid-project, creating duplicate documentation structures
- Multiple feature directories explore same concepts with different names
- Mix of original project structure (docs/) and Agent OS structure (.agent-os/)
- Working system but messy organization

## What to Extract for Final Product
When ready for production/portfolio submission:

### Core Product (Keep)
- `/backend` - FastAPI implementation
- `/frontend/contentful-app` - React UI
- Essential docs (README, setup instructions)
- `.env.template`
- `requirements.txt`, `package.json`

### Scaffolding to Remove
- Duplicate feature directories in .agent-os/features/
- Agent OS instructions (helped development, not needed for product)
- Multiple roadmap/planning documents
- Development-time protocols (lanesborough)

### System Files (Evaluate)
- `.claude/` - Keep if continuing development, remove for portfolio
- `memory-bank/` - Archive development history
- `.agent-os/` - Extract key insights, remove scaffolding

## Why We're Waiting
- System is functional now - don't risk breaking it
- Need working demo more than clean structure
- Easier to extract clean product after features complete
- Agent OS helping us develop, will remove when done

## Target Final Structure
```
contentful-marketo-ai-bridge/
├── backend/          # Core Python app
├── frontend/         # Contentful UI
├── docs/            # User-facing documentation only
├── tests/           # Test suites
├── .env.template    # Configuration template
└── README.md        # Clean product overview
```

**Note**: This cleanup is for AFTER main development is complete.
Current priority: Contentful integration and Vision features.
