## Current Session Notes

- [5:44:56 AM] [Unknown User] Completed Portfolio Verification & Documentation Sprint: Successfully completed Agent OS installation and portfolio verification. Verified feature-complete AI Content Activation Engine with 30 passing tests, comprehensive architecture using provider-agnostic patterns, and professional documentation. Mock services provide accurate simulation for demonstration. Project ready for Contentful AI Engineer role portfolio presentation. All Lanesborough Protocol decisions properly documented with correct model attribution (GA: Gemini 2.5 Pro, IA: Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
- [5:44:23 AM] [Unknown User] Completed mock service validation: Verified mock services provide accurate simulation: MockMarketingService returns realistic responses with 250ms latency, proper list mapping (ML_DEMO_001-003, HS_LIST_001-002), and appropriate fields matching real API patterns. Platform factory correctly defaults to mock mode. AI service has fallback handling for API failures. All mock services suitable for portfolio demonstration without external dependencies.
- [5:43:02 AM] [Unknown User] Completed Agent OS installation and LP convergence: Successfully installed Agent OS with complete product documentation (mission, technical-spec, user-stories, roadmap, decisions).
